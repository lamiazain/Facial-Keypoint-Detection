# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Overview
Facial Keypoint Detection is a machine learning project aimed at detecting key facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth from images. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately identify these points, enabling various applications like emotion recognition, facial recognition, and augmented reality.

## Features
- **Accurate Detection**: Leverages deep learning models for precise facial keypoint identification.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing images in real-time for applications.
- **Customizable**: Easy to adapt and modify the model for specific use cases.

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `opencv-python`, `torch`, `torchvision`, etc.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lamiazain/Facial-Keypoint-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Facial-Keypoint-Detection
   ```


## Usage
To run the keypoint detection on an image, run notebook#3.


## Dataset
This project uses the [Facial Keypoints Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data) provided by Kaggle. Ensure you download the dataset and update the paths in your code accordingly.

## Training
To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```
Make sure to adjust the hyperparameters in `train.py` based on your requirements.

## Results
Include example images showing the keypoints detected by the model. For instance:
